'E's dead, that's what's wrong with it!
No, no, 'e's uh,...he's resting.         Look, matey, I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now.
No no he's not dead, he's, he's restin'! Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, idn'it, ay? Beautiful plumage!         The plumage don't enter into it. It's stone dead.
Nononono, no, no! 'E's resting!         Now that's what I call a dead parrot.
Yeah! You stunned him, just as he was wakin' up! Norwegian Blues stun easily, major.         Um...now look...now look, mate, I've definitely 'ad enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased, and when I purchased it not 'alf an hour ago, you assured me that its total lack of movement was due to it bein' tired and shagged out following a prolonged squawk.
Well, he's...he's, ah...probably pining for the fjords.         PININ' for the FJORDS?!?!?!? What kind of talk is that?, look, why did he fall flat on his back the moment I got 'im home?
The Norwegian Blue prefers keepin' on it's back! Remarkable bird, id'nit, squire? Lovely plumage!         Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot when I got it home, and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been NAILED there.
Well, o'course it was nailed there! If I hadn't nailed that bird down, it would have nuzzled up to those bars, bent 'em apart with its beak, and VOOM! Feeweeweewee!         "VOOM"?!? Mate, this bird wouldn't "voom" if you put four million volts through it! 'E's bleedin' demised!
No no! 'E's pining!         'E's not pinin'! 'E's passed on!
This parrot is no more!
He has ceased to be!
'E's expired and gone to meet 'is maker!
'E's a stiff!
Bereft of life, 'e rests in peace!
If you hadn't nailed 'im to the perch 'e'd be pushing up the daisies!
'Is metabolic processes are now 'istory!
'E's off the twig!
'E's kicked the bucket
'E's shuffled off 'is mortal coil
Run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisibile!!
This is an ex-parrot!!
