Aiiieeeee, killing multigate handler.
Ringbreak (0B)
Warning: multigate on fire.
Attempted to kill the idle multigate, giving up.
Somebody set us up the gate!
I am the weakest link, goodbye...
I send you this quit in order to have your advice
Bah! !this !that. Do it yourself!
Game over. Insert coins to continue...
Maximum command count exceeded. Restarting...
End of endless loop reached.
Finally... Some rest
Error: out of bits
Bitbucket full.
And now for something completely different...
Off to chase the etherbunny.
Any time is guinness time.
Multibeer^H^H^H^Hgate restarting
My presence is required elsewhere.
Will I dream?
Inserting some more common sense.

Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
Famous last words:
As a computer, I find your faith in technology amusing!
24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case, coincidence?
