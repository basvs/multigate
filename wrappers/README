This is the part where you put the specs for the modules and how to create
new modules. Adding a module to the multigate process should not be a lot
harder than copying a client into the directory and do a bit of tweaking.
A wrapper is be available with a correct interface to the Multigate
process. Just make sure the wrapper understands what the client is saying.
The only thing that should come out of the wrapper is:
- who is the sender.
- what is the message.

Why a wrapper? You can take just about any client, strip the output with
regexps and feed whats left to Multigate. This way it will be possible to
have 'normal' messaging clients as part of the Multigate system.
A wrapper is also useful to combine seperate sending/receiving tools into
one interface towards the mail Multigate process.
